#### Description:
The To-Do List Manager is a command-line application designed to help you stay organized, track tasks, and enhance your productivity. With user-friendly features, this Python program offers an intuitive way to manage your daily tasks and prioritize your goals.

To-Do List Python Project
This is a simple console-based "To-Do List" project implemented in Python. It allows users to manage tasks by adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing the current task list.

## Project Structure:
The project consists of two main files:

project.py: This file contains the main implementation of the "To-Do List" application. It includes functions to add tasks, complete tasks, and view tasks. The main loop of the application is defined in the main function.

test_project.py: This file contains test functions for the functions defined in project.py. The tests are written using the pytest framework to ensure the correctness of the project's functionality.

## Features:
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the "To-Do List" application:
Enter 1 to add a new task.
Enter 2 to mark a task as completed.
Enter 3 to view the list of tasks.
Enter 4 to exit the application.
